Our app generates a dynamically adjusting heatmap of data from only a few previously measured points by using Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation to estimate values over a grid. From here, each point is assigned a color from blue to red, with blue representing higher values and red representing lower values. This simplifies data collection and allows us to get a visual summary of measurements without having to measure individual grid points.
